# Recommender systems
Recommender systems offer relevant suggestions that makes choosing easier.

## Technique 1: Collaborative Filtering
Also is the key in blockchain.

Collaborative Filtering Process:

## 1.Load Data
Create user-item matrix. Standardize ratings.
### User-based: Recommendations are generated by considering the preferences in the user's neighborhood (similar users).

### Item-based: Recommendations are generated using the neighborhood of items by finding similarites between items. 

## 2.Calculaate Similarity Matrix
Similarity may be measured using Euclidean distance, cosine distance, Pearson coefficient,Jaccard distance

## 3.Predict Unknown Ratings
For an unknown item, obtain ratings of **n nearest neighbors** who have rated it. Computed a score weighted by similarity to target user.

## 4.Recommend
Suggest top k items. 

But these methods have **Sparsity Problem** or **Cold Start Problem** 
* Sparsity Problem: Users haven't rated/used most items.
* Cold Start Problem: An extreme case of sparsity problem: New users dont have any ratings or new products dont have any ratings

## Technique 2: Content-Based Filtering: 
Use item properties and user preferences to the item properties to build the recommendation model.

## Technique 3: Context Aware Recommendation: 
Take the context into account before computing. User preferences may differ with the context (such as time of day, season, mood, place, location...)
